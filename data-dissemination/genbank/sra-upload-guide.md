## BioProject

## BioSamples

The SRA submission wizard links a BioProject and BioSamples to your sequencing metadata and data files. You can upload your raw sequence files in advance using the command line protocols FTP or ascp, or if you have a few small (less than a few GB) files you can upload your files through your browser as the last step of your submission. For more information please see the below links, and let me know if you have questions at any step.

Summary: [EXTERNAL] PacBio Amplicon Sequence Submission

Details:
Good afternoon,
 
I had a few questions about submitting PacBio amplicon reads to GenBank.
 
I have a dataset of PacBio HiFi sequences of fungi from soil, leaf litter, and mushrooms. Because they are amplicon reads (ITS-LSU sequences, ~1500nt), we do not assemble them. We strictly use them for species identification using this amplicon region as a species barcode. However, we do go through extensive quality filtering, chimera checks, etc., so I would not consider these sequences to be ‘raw’, though they are ‘unassembled.’
 
What is the correct route of submitting these sequences to GenBank? I have seen some PacBio amplicons sequences on GenBank where authors include their bioinformatics pipeline name as the assembly program through the GenBank submission, though the sequences aren’t truly assembled. I want to make sure my sequences are on GenBank such that it is clear they are unassembled, but also clear that they aren’t ‘raw’ in the sense that there was no quality control.
 
Thank you!
