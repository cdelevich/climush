# Globus

[Globus](https://www.globus.org/data-transfer) is the interface that we use to transfer sequence files among users. The method of transferring data with Globus depends on where your data are located, or where you want your downloaded data to go.

## Upload Sequences to the CliMush Sequences Guest Collection

Where are your sequences located?

### from personal computer

To upload or download sequences from your computer's hard drive, you will need to install [Globus Personal Connection](https://docs.globus.org/globus-connect-personal/install/windows/).

### from university's HPC cluster account

If your sequences are on your HPC cluster account, you should be able to transfer files from the online Globus File Manager.
